# StockMarketPredictionAnalysisANN
This project focuses on predicting stock market trends using Linear Regression and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). It demonstrates how machine learning models can analyze historical stock data and provide future trend predictions. The project emphasizes both regression-based analysis and advanced neural network techniques for accurate forecasting.

Features
Data Collection: Historical stock market data sourced from reliable APIs or datasets.
Preprocessing: Data cleaning, normalization, and splitting into training and test sets.
Linear Regression Model:
Implements a straightforward regression technique to predict stock prices.
Visualizes the linear relationship between variables.
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN):
Utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units for handling sequential data.
Provides robust predictions by capturing temporal dependencies.
Performance Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² Score for model evaluation.
Visualization: Graphical representation of historical vs. predicted stock prices.
Tools and Technologies
Languages: Python
Libraries: NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras
Environment: Jupyter Notebook
Implementation Steps
Data Preparation:

Import stock market data.
Normalize features to improve model performance.
Model Building:

Train and test a Linear Regression model for baseline predictions.
Develop an LSTM-based RNN to enhance predictive accuracy.
Model Evaluation:

Compare results from both models using performance metrics.
Visualize predictions against actual stock prices.
Deployment (Optional): Export the trained model for integration into applications or dashboards.

Prerequisites
Python installed with required libraries (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, tensorflow, matplotlib).
Basic knowledge of machine learning and deep learning.
